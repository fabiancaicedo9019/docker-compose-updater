# Description
# If you need to update multiple applications you must configure and run this file.
# The sh file only works with an absolute path.
# Additionally, the repository must have a docker-compose.yml file,
# which will allow updating the application based on docker compose.
# The repository must be public.
#
# You can run the file in 2 ways:
# - Allows to release the console after executing the line
#   nohup {path}/docker-compose-updater.sh {github_username}/{github_repository} &!
# - Execute the line and wait for it to finish to continue with the next one.
#   {path}/docker-compose-updater.sh {github_username}/{github_repository}
